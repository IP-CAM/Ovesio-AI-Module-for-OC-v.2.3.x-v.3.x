---

## Key Features

### Compatibility
- Fully compatible with OpenCart **2.3 - 3.x**

### Translation Capabilities
- Translations are performed **automatically in the background**
- Once a translation is completed, it is updated on the website â€” translations are **not instant**
- Translations are available for:
  - Product names
  - Descriptions
  - Meta titles and keywords
  - Specification attributes
  - Attribute groups
  - Product options
  - *(Information pages support coming soon)*
- Translations are **not repeated** unless the original content has changed

### Description Generation
- Automatic AI-generated descriptions for both **products** and **categories**
- Custom logic for when to generate:
  - For products/categories with existing descriptions shorter than a defined character limit
  - For **out-of-stock products**
  - For **disabled products and categories**
- Two modes available:
  - **One time only**
  - **On each resource update**
- Descriptions are also performed **in the background**, not instantly

### AI Description Generator Options
From the **AI Description Generator** tab:
- Enable/disable description generation per resource type
- Set thresholds:
  - Ignore product descriptions longer than X characters
  - Ignore category descriptions longer than X characters
- Set inclusion logic for out-of-stock and disabled products/categories
- Choose when new descriptions should be created:
  - One time only
  - On each update

### Feed Support
- Multiple types of feeds are available:
  - Products
  - Categories
  - Attributes
  - Attribute groups
  - Product options
- These feeds enable Ovesio to periodically check and update resources
- Feed URLs are listed in the **Translate Settings** tab

### Cron Integration
- Automate processing with a cron job:
  ```
  * * * * */5 curl -k -L "https://yourdomain.com/index.php?route=extension/module/ovesio/cronjob&hash=YOUR_HASH" > /dev/null 2>&1
  ```
- The cron job:
  - Runs every 5 minutes
  - Processes up to **40 entries per execution**
  - Triggers both translation and description generation
- The cron URL and hash are available in the **General** tab
